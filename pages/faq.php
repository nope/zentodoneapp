<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Zen To Done App is a web application based on Leo Babauta's Zen To Done productivity system. In it's simplest form, ZTDA is a to-do list manager that allows you to focus on a few important items, one at a time. To begin, when you log into your account, you'll see an 'Add' link in the top navigation. Click that to open a pop-up box that will allow you to enter your tasks. Each week, visit your 'Plan' page to set your <img src="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/resources/images/small-rocks.png" /> <strong>Big Rocks</strong> (tasks that are important to you). The day a Big Rock is scheduled for on the calendar, it becomes an <strong>MIT</strong> (Most Important Task). Of course, you can add tasks that aren't Big Rocks or MITs. You may also add contexts to your tasks (i.e. <em>@work, @computer, etc.</em>). It is best to complete these MITs early in the day to make sure you move your life goals forward.</p>

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
<p>Why should you use any to-do list manager? Because it is supposed to make your life simpler. If Zen To Done App doesn't work for you, there are numerous other to-do list managers available out there. Use what works for you.</p>

<h3>How can I sign up?</h3>
<p>Zen To Done App is currently in its beta release. That means there are about 800 people right now kicking my baby's tires, checking under her hood, revving up her engine. If you signed up for beta testing and want to have a go at some tire kicking, you should have received an email by now with your beta invite code. Make sure you check your Spam folder too! You may sign up for the Zen To Done App newsletter on the home page if you would like to be informed when its your turn to kick some tires (you devil you).</p>

<h3>Is Zen To Done App free?</h3>
<p>At present, Zen To Done App is free! I am looking into revenue generating possibilities. Perhaps either a mobile app or a premium features upgrade. Maybe with each purchase you'll get a little baby unicorn. Whatever it is, I don't plan on an exorbitant pricing scheme. Something simple, that is a one-time fee (I personally hate recurring payments; feels too much like debt to me!) and something that'll keep the book library growing. If you have any thoughts, please let me know.</p>

<h3>Do you accept donations?</h3>
<p>Donations are wonderful gifts but please give them to a more deserving cause. <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> is a great place to send your money. While it's not technically donating, you are lending money to change lives. It's a pretty worthwhile cause. If you find this site useful, please show your appreciation by paying it forward. No amount is too small. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama said, <strong><em>"If you think small things don't make a difference, try spending a night in a room with a mosquito!"</em></strong></p>

<h3>Is there a mobile app available?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not at this time. I'm a one-woman design and development shop so creating a full-featured, robust mobile app does take some time (and Mama - yeah, that's me - does need time for eating, sleeping and a little <em>fun</em>). Again, sign up for the newsletter to stay up-to-date.</p>

<h3>Will you add <em>X</em> feature?</h3>
<p>Thanks to the many feedback emails I've received, I've got quite a bit of features that might be implemented. If you send me your idea or feature request, I'll definitely take it into consideration (but you have to send it to me first silly). If you desperately want your feature, 12 foot home-made birthday cakes are acceptable bribery (no, no - just kidding! I think . . .). I'm working my little fingers to the bone coding and am working from most requested feature to least. I will <em>try</em> to get every feature request added but I can't promise. Hope you understand.</p>

<h3>I sent you feedback yesterday. Why haven't you emailed me back yet?</h3>
<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately), I work a full-time job, have a few freelance clients and other projects that help pay the bills that keep me very busy. Zen To Done App is a labor of love right now and I like to email people back when I have the time to craft a well-written response. I really appreciate you emailing me your feedback and thoughts and think you deserve an email that is personal. If you emailed me during the week, I'll respond to you by Sunday night; I also release any changes made to the site on Sunday evening.</p>

<h3>I have a support question. How do I get in touch with you?</h3>
<p>If you need support for Zen To Done App, please feel free to <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL.DS.'contact'.DS; ?>">contact me through here &raquo;</a>. If you have more of a bug to report, please send <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL.DS.'feedback'.DS; ?>">feedback through here &raquo;</a>. In both cases, please be as detailed as possible. If you receive an error, please make sure to add that in your message.</p>

<h3>Who owns my info? And what about privacy?</h3>
<p>Privacy is a huge concern for me (that's why I <strong>refuse</strong> to use Facebook). All of your items/tasks/account info is yours and yours alone. I will <strong>NEVER</strong> sell your information, pass out your email address, or allow third party companies access to your info. Also, any of your information is only viewable by you. There are no account settings to allow public viewing of your tasks. I use your personal account information to improve the site functionality but that's it (it's not like I'm wading through your info; the code just uses the relevant information, k?).</p>

<h3>What are your site policies?</h3>
<p>I ask that you respect Zen To Done App. I suppose that means that I feel like this website is my first born child. I just sent her off to grade school and while I know she is a little awkward at the moment, she'll grow out of it with some nurturing, a few cat fights, and lots of love. Oh, and some legal mumbo-jumbo; using this site means you agree that I am not liable for data loss, inaccessibility to your account, or denial of services. If you want to read up on the full terms and conditions, you can view them here: <a href="<?php echo SITE_URL.DS.'terms-and-conditions'.DS; ?>">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></p>

<h3>This site <em>#@!%&#!</em> sucks! Give me my money back, you pathetic excuse for a developer.</em></h3>
<p>While I appreciate (almost) any form of criticism, this is just not cool. Take a look at the website address; you know, the one with <strong>ZEN</strong> in it? Yes, take a breath. Yes, focus on the present moment. No, you don't get any money back. No, you cannot talk to another human being that way. I'm a pretty tough gal but comments like those above make me cry. Please don't make Nikki cry. Please don't send nasty little things like that my way.</p>

<h3>Who created this?</h3>
<p>My name is Nikki Selene Lamagna and around the web I'm known as <strong>GeekDesignGirl</strong>. What was that? Do I have a website you ask? You bet I do! It's called <strong>The GeekDesignGirl Project</strong> and you can visit it here: <a href="http://geekdesigngirl.com">http://geekdesigngirl.com</a></p>
