Hi everyone!

This is Nikki. Zen To Done App is a PHP project that uses Leo Babauta's Zen To Done Productivity System as its backbone. You can check out his site at http://zenhabits.net to learn more about Zen To Done (it's a simplified version of Getting Things Done (GTD)).

Mr. Babauta 'uncopyrights' his material. In that same spirit, I'm releasing the source code for Zen To Done App. I'm doing this in the hopes that we can make the site better and I will more than likely learn something new!

The production site is located at http://zentodoneapp.com.

If changes are made to this repo, I'll push them on Sunday nights to the live site. If you set up your own site with the code, please do let me know. I'd be excited to see what others are doing with it.

You can always reach me by email with any questions or thoughts: nikki@geekdesigngirl.com

Hope this README finds you in high spirits!

Nikki
